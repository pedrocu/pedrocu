### Pete Minor's Repository ðŸ‘‹
I'm completing a post baccalaureate in Computer Science at University of Colorado Boulder.  I also have a masterâ€™s degree in economics from The American University in Washington DC.  I have spent much of my career doing many things in economics, which today, would be called data sciences.  I like working with big data and economic models.  Much of my experience has been in global economic modeling including trade agreements.   I have also worked on antitrust cases requiring the analysis of large corporate databases.

My goal in completeing a computer science degree is to refine and expand my core set of skills in data and analysis to expand my work into new areas and projects.
